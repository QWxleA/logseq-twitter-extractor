A quick utility to parse a twitter link into a post with a user specified template. Inspired by the Roam Smartblock for twitter extraction.

## Instructions
1. Navigate to a block with the twitter URL
2. Use the slash command `/Parse  Twitter URL`
3. Enjoy :)

## Configuration
1. In plugin settings, you can configure custom templates
2. Use {URL}, {Name}, {Username}, {Date}, and {Tweet} as placeholders in the template which will be auto replaced
3. Template 1 is the block that the logseq block with URL will be replaced into
4. Template 2 is an optional block that will be indented under the first block
